# creditScoreClassification

I conducted an in-depth analysis of how debt management, payment behavior, and demographic factors influence credit scores using a dataset of 12,500 customers. By implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature engineering and K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, I was able to uncover insightful relationships and segment customers based on their credit behaviour. This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering for predictive analysis. The research questions, methodology and results are elaborated in the project report.
