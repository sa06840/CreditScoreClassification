# Credit Score Classification

Overview: I conducted an in-depth analysis of how debt management, payment behavior, and demographic factors influence credit scores using a dataset of 12,500 customers. By implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature engineering and K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, I was able to uncover insightful relationships and segment customers based on their credit behaviour. This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering for predictive analysis. The research questions, methodology and results are elaborated in the project report.

Aim: Identify key factors affecting credit scores and analyze how their variations influence credit scores overall

Action: Studied the impact of various factors on credit scores by conducting statistical tests (ANOVA, Eta squared, Chi-square, Cramerâ€™s V) on monthly data from 12,500 customers. Identified debt management, payment behavior, and demographic factors as the most significant. Used Pandas to implement PCA for feature engineering, K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, and logistic regression to quantify their impact

Outcomes: Debt management has the highest impact on credit scores followed by payment behavior. A 1 unit increase towards bad debt management decreases the odds of a good credit score by 52.2%
