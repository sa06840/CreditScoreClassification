# Credit Score Classification

Overview: I conducted an in-depth analysis of how debt management, payment behavior, and demographic factors influence credit scores using a dataset of 12,500 customers. By implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature engineering and K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, I was able to uncover insightful relationships and segment customers based on their credit behaviour. This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering for predictive analysis. The research questions, methodology and results are elaborated in the project report.

Aim: Understand spatiotemporal crime patterns in London and identify hotspots for effective resource allocation

Action: Conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of crime patterns in London using Metropolitan Police data.
Utilized Pandas, GeoPandas, and Altair to plot line graphs and heatmaps for temporal trends, and choropleth maps with shapefiles for spatial distribution. Applied K-Means clustering to identify crime hotspots and examined correlations between crime rates and demographic factors using census data

Outcomes: Crime incidents peaked in 2019 and dropped sharply in 2020. Central London has higher crime rates with Westminster leading at 251 incidents/1,000 people. Hotspots included Oxford, Regent and Bond Streets
